Overview
===============================
This repository contains a manuscript in preperation for submission to the American Geophysical Union journal entitled "Geochemistry Geophysic Geosystems" along with the raw data and code used for the manuscript's data analysis.

===============================

2014_Osler_Code
-------------------------------
The star of this folder is an IPython notebook that contains all of the statistical data analysis and plotting for the manuscript. In addition to the IPython notebook, the folder contains the pmag.py, pmagplotlib, and pmagpyrc.py libraries of PmagPy version 2.206 as well as a newly developed library IPmag.py that modifies some of the interactive programs of PmagPy for use in the IPython environment in addition to providing some new functions. This folder will also contain a PDF version of notebook to be viewed outside of the IPython. Note that the IPython notebook can also be viewed online without an IPython installation at this link: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/Swanson-Hysell/2014_Swanson-Hysell-et-al_Osler/master/2014_Osler_Code/2014_Osler_Data_Analysis.ipynb

2014_Osler_Data
-------------------------------
This folder contains three files:
  1 *Simpson_Island_alldata.xlsx* This excel spreadsheet has all of the specimen level data and details the flow mean calculations. It also contains the worksheets that will be used to contribute these data to the MagIC database when the paper is accepted.
  2 *SimpsonIsland_OslerData.csv* This csv file contains the flow (i.e. site) mean paleomagnetic data as well as the locations of the flows stratigraphical and geographically (lat, long is in WGS84).
  3 *Halls1974_Osler_reversed.csv* This csv file contains the longitude and latitude of the virtual geomagnetic poles from the Halls (1974) study of the Osler Volcanics that come from the reversedly magnetized portion of the stratigraphy below the angular unconformity.
  
2014_Osler_Manuscript
-------------------------------
This folder contains the manuscript and figure files. The source .tex file and individual figure files are in the folder along with the compiled .pdf file.
