2014_Osler_Code
-------------------------------
The star of this folder is an IPython notebook that contains all of the statistical data analysis and plotting for the manuscript. In addition to the IPython notebook, the folder contains the pmag.py, pmagplotlib, and pmagpyrc.py libraries of PmagPy version 2.206 as well as a newly developed library IPmag.py that modifies some of the interactive programs of PmagPy for use in the IPython environment in addition to providing new functions. This folder also contains a PDF version of notebook to be viewed outside of the IPython that is the supporting online material to the G^3 manuscript. Note that the IPython notebook can also be viewed online as rendered html without an IPython installation at this link: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/Swanson-Hysell/2014_Swanson-Hysell-et-al_Osler/master/2014_Osler_Code/2014_Osler_Data_Analysis.ipynb

2014_Osler_Data
-------------------------------
This folder contains three files:
### Simpson_Island_alldata.xlsx ###
This excel spreadsheet has all of the specimen level data and details the flow mean calculations. It also contains the worksheets that will be used to contribute these data to the MagIC database when the paper is accepted.
### SimpsonIsland_OslerData.csv ###
This csv file contains the flow (i.e. site) mean paleomagnetic data as well as the locations of the flows stratigraphical and geographically (lat, long is in WGS84).
### Halls1974_data.csv ###
This csv file contains data from the Halls (1974) study of the Osler Volcanics.
### Tauxe2009a_data.csv ###
This csv file contains data from the Tauxe and Kodama (2009) study of the North Shore Volcanic Group.
