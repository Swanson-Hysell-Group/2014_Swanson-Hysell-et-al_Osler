Description of Supporting Information
This supplemental supporting information is comprised of a single compiled PDF document that was generated from an IPython notebook (http://ipython.org) using `nbconvert --to latex`. This PDF contains the code, output (graphical and numerical) and associated text annotations for the data analysis described in the manuscript. While all of the code and output is included in this PDF file so that it can stand alone, the raw code including function libraries that are not standard scipy packages (pmag.py and pmagplotlib.py developed by Lisa Tauxe; IPmag.py developed for this project) and imported data files can be downloaded from https://github.com/Swanson-Hysell/2014_Swanson-Hysell-et-al_Osler.

The contents of the PDF file is included as a hyperlinked table of contents on the first page of the PDF file and is also provided below:
